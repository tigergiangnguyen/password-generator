# 03 JavaScript: Password Generator

## Description

This is a odd week so I was given a starter code that needed to be modified to satisfy the acceptance criteria. The website was made to create 
a random password filled with symbols, letters, and numbers. This application can help prevent hackers from getting into the user's account by
generating a complex password. I learned how to combined arrays and add a randomize function into the application so that each stings are selected at random. JavaScript isn't easy but learning the logic and seeing what it does to the application is just the tip of the mountain!

## Instuctions of Application

    1. To create a generated password, the user would click the button named "Generate Password" then prompts will appear an alerts asking questions about how would they like their password to be filled with.
 
    2. A prompt will appear asking the user how long will they like their password to be ("Equal to or between 8 and 128"), any number outside will kick the user out the function and return a message inside the textbox to "Please try again".

    3. All prompts appear from there will have the option to click "OK" or "Cancel. Clicking "OK" will run the function to be true and execute the line to add the character in the array. Clicking "Cancel" will run the function to be false and not execute the line then moves to the next prompt.

    4. More prompts will appear asking the user If they want their new password to have lowercase letters and/or uppercase letters. ("Generating passwords with specific questions to make the it more complicated to have the most protection") then so on for symbols and numbers.

    5. Once answered all the prompts, the generate password will appear within the textbox of the application.
